This is a fairly common raspberry pi project, so I followed various online guides to setup the software on my raspberry pi.

This project is a neat way to repurpose any old monitor as a "smart mirror." It provides the following information to whomever looks at it: the current time, a customizable calendar module, current weather conditions/forecast, a customizable RSS news feed, and a customizable "compliments" module (I added miscellaneous facts and quotes as well). Mine was powered using a raspberry pi 3 running the standard raspbian jessie OS.

The software was developed by Michael Teeuw, and is open source (see https://magicmirror.builders for more info).

As mentioned above, essentially all the modules that are included in this software are customizable. The calendar can display information from an iCloud or Google calendar, news sources can be added or removed from the RSS feed, and the "compliments" can easily be modified/deleted.

The acrylic sheet used for my mirror is very thin (like construction paper), so it tends to warp very easily when adjusting the position of the mirror. Future improvements to this project may include the following:
--Acquire an actual two way mirror as an alternative to acrylic sheet
--Construct a wooden frame or a stand for the monitor
