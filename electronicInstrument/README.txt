This project was created by Amanda Ghassaei
Here is the link to the instructable: http://www.instructables.com/id/Electronic-Instrument/. You can find all the relevant schematics and code there.

This is the description of the project as taken from the instructable:

"This electronic instrument allows you to sequence and loop audio and MIDI data.  Most of the time I use it to sequence drum samples so I can play around with different beats and rhythms.  The really great thing about this instrument is that it is very portable, it fits in your hands easily, runs off a single 9 volt battery, and has a headphone jack that you can plug into.  If you connect it to your computer via usb you can also use it to send MIDI data, this way you can communicate with other electronic instruments or software environments that understand MIDI."

Some remarks:

--This project has been disassembled

--I did not build a wooden project enclosure

--I got the circuit to work with the default sounds. As Amanda points out in the intractable, there is a tool you can use to encode your own audio files for use in the instrument, enabling the sounds to be customized by the user. However, the arduino clone I have doesn't have a lot of program storage space, so the audio files I wanted to use had to be very heavily compressed and extremely short in duration. Thus, it wasn't a very practical instrument in the end. However, it was still a fulfilling experience to finally hear it working and an intriguing digital signal processing project.
